## Group Chatting Application

### Overview
This is a simple multi-client chat application built using Java. The project consists of a server and multiple clients that can communicate with each other in a group chat environment. The user interface is built using Swing, and communication is handled via sockets.

### Features
- **Multi-client support:** Multiple users can join the chat and communicate simultaneously.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with Java Swing for an interactive chat window.
- **Real-time messaging:** Messages are instantly shared with all connected clients.
- **User identification:** Each user has a unique name displayed in the chat.
- **Draggable UI:** Users can move the chat window freely.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Swing (GUI)**
- **Sockets (Networking)**
- **Multi-threading**

### Project Structure
```
group.chatting.application/
â”‚â”€â”€ Server.java       # Handles client connections and message broadcasting
â”‚â”€â”€ UserOne.java      # First client implementation with GUI
â”‚â”€â”€ UserTwo.java      # Second client implementation with GUI
```

### How to Run
#### **1. Start the Server**
Run the `Server.java` file to start the chat server.
```sh
